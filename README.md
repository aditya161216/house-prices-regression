# house-prices-regression
By: Ved Rajesh and Aditya Vikrant

As college students moving into our senior year, we are looking for off-campus housing. The average rent in Boston is $2887, which is 13% higher than a year ago. This is extremely high, especially for college students, so we would want to find cheaper housing with fewer amenities. This is why we are looking at housing prices for our project, and specifically, trying to figure out which houses would be cheaper based on their various ‘features’. We want to build a model that is at least 90% accurate so that we can use that model to find apartments that fit our needs for the right price.

This is why we chose to do the Kaggle competition “House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques”. The dataset we are given has over 30 different features which makes it very in-depth. Additionally, the dataset is also based on the Boston Housing dataset which is again very relevant to us, as we are college students in Boston currently looking for affordable housing.
